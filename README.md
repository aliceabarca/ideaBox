### Context:

We had 6 days to complete this project. We completed this project during the fourth week of Module 1 at the Turing School of Software and Design. It took us a total of 6 days to finish the application. The main goal of the project was to showcase our abilities in developer collaboration, as well as create well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

### Learning Goals:

- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage functions, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills

### Wins + Challenges:

### Wins:

- Accessing DOM and Data Model.
- Utilizing event delegation and bubbling to have efficient event listeners and non repeating functions.
- Improving our git workflow so all collaborators have the same understanding of the status of our project. 

### Challenges:
- Updating CSS styling as we added features.
- Naming our variables and functions was a challenge at first, but we conciously decided what the function or variable was doing and kept the naming consistent accordingly. 
- Accessing innerHTML elements.
